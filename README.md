###0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
#Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!
#First step:
The first step is to write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building my first full web application: the AirBnB clone.
This first step is very important because I will use what I build during this project with all other following projects:
HTML/CSS templating,
database storage,
API,
front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help me to:

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization,
serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
What’s a command interpreter?


Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object

#Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, I should be able to:

Create a Python package.
Develop a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module.
Implement unit testing in a large project.
Serialize and deserialize a class.
Read and write JSON files.
Manage datetime in Python.
Understand UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers).
Utilize *args and **kwargs in Python.
Handle named arguments in functions effectively.
Copyright - Plagiarism
I are expected to come up with solutions to meet the learning objectives independently.
Plagiarism, in any form, is strictly prohibited and may result in removal from the program.
Do not publish any content related to this project.
